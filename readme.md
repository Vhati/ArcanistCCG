ArcanistCCG
===========

ArcanistCCG is a virtual card table that will allow you to play any card game available. All you need are images of the cards and/or the cardtext datafile (supports Apprentice dats too). It's in Java, so it's not limited to a single OS, and it's free: no membership, no central server; internet is optional.

ArcanistCCG is designed to make adding new games as easy as possible: a spoiler and images. It does this by generically supporting all the features a game may require and by not handling rules. It really is just like a table. As far as it's concerned, you're just dragging a jpeg around, not the Mighty Club of Fubar.


Requirements
------------
* Java (1.6 or higher).
    * http://www.java.com/en/download/
* WinXP SP1 can't run Java 1.7.
    * (1.7 was built with VisualStudio 2010, causing a DecodePointer error.)
    * To get 1.6, you may have to google "jdk-6u45-windows-i586.exe".
